## Exception Intent

We want people building extensions, developer toolkits and frameworks, language packs and themes for Ext libraries to be able to publicly distribute them under less restrictive license terms despite the fact that version 3 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL") may require them to be licensed under the GPL.

This Exception does not grant usage or distribution of any Ext development library under a license other the GPL and cannot be applied to end-user applications. For applications, please refer to the Open Source License Exception for Applications.

## Terms and Conditions

### Definitions

1. Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in the GPL.
1. **"Library"** means Ext JS or Ext GWT, for which this exception is applicable.
1. **"Code"** means source code for the Library or Extension.
1. **"Images"** means images distributed with Code.
1. **"Modification"** means a visual change or enhancement made to a Library Component ("Component") by means of modifying the standard functionality or visual appearance of the Component.
1. **"Extension"** means the combination of Code and Images to form a Modification or a completely new and original Component.

### Additional Grants

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 3.0 of the GPL:

You are free to distribute an Extension licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in section 5, as long as:

1. Your Extension does not contain any Code or modified Code from the Library.
1. You do not distribute the Library, as a whole or in part, with your Extension. Optionally, you should include instructions for developers using your Extension explaining how to obtain the Library.
1. You include PROMINENT notice in EVERY location you display the license information for your Extension that it uses the Library, the Library is distributed under the terms of the GPL v3 and include a link to http://extjs.com/license.
1. Your Extension:
   1. is distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and
   1. is accompanied by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the Extension
1. Your Extension can reasonably be considered to be adding to or modifying standard functionality of the Library for software development purposes and not an independent and separate Application in itself.

### Applicability

This exception applies to Ext JS version 2.2 or later and Ext GWT version 1.0 or later released under the GPL that contain a notice placed by Ext JS, LLC saying that Extentions for the Library may be distributed under the terms of this Exception.

**This Exception can in no way be considered to grant rights to use or distribute the Library under any license other than the GPL v3.**

### Termination

If you fail to comply with any of the terms in this Exception then all rights granted to you herein are void and your rights immediately revert back to those granted in the GPL v3.
